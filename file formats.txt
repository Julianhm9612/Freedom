BUF - ???
    - no header
    - ASCII resource names throughout
    - identifiers at the end
    - random data referenced externally?
    - not present in ErrorMessages

    - contains GMS instance names
    - contains GMS instance auxiliary buffers (not understood)

GMS - compressed
    - game instances
    - cross-refs to PRM - mostly understood, able to render entire scene into .obj
    - refers to function names (script not figured out yet)

LOC - hierarchical localization data
    - fully understood
    - not present in ErrorMessages

OCT - ?

PRM - object geometry
    - we're able to enumerate models
    - dump OBJs with correct vertex positions and load those into Blender
    - doesn't describe model placement in world (see GMS)
    - a lot of questions remain
    - doesn't seem to contain world terrain (??)

RMC - ?
RMI - ?
SGP - ?
SND - ?
SUP - ?

TEX - contains textures
    - texdump managed to parse what we tried
    - also contains reference to WAV files - this part is not understood

ZGF - compressed font collection
    - able to reliably decompress
    - unable to reliably tell font boundaries
    - (low priority)

xtr - custom format to help mapping file layouts and find gaps in understood data
